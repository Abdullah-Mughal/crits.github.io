                <h1>Structured Data Exchange Formats</h1>
                <h5>Sharing threat data means nothing if the systems on the receiving end can't understand it. That's why we are working to expand our <a href="https://github.com/crits/crits/wiki/Structured-Data-Exchange-Format-Implementations">use</a> of structured data exchange formats. These formats are open source, readily available, and already being widely adopted across the technology industry.</h5>

                <p>STIX&#0153; is a collaborative community-driven effort to define and develop a standardized language to represent structured cyber threat information. The STIX Language intends to convey the full range of potential cyber threat information and strives to be fully expressive, flexible, extensible, automatable, and as human-readable as possible. All interested parties are welcome to participate in evolving STIX as part of its open, collaborative community.</p>

                <p>CybOX&#0153; International in scope and free for public use, CybOX is a standardized schema for the specification, capture, characterization, and communication of events or stateful properties that are observable in the operational domain. A wide variety of high-level cyber security use cases rely on such information including: event management/logging, malware characterization, intrusion detection, incident response/management, attack pattern characterization, etc. CybOX provides a common mechanism (structure and content) for addressing cyber observables across and among this full range of use cases improving consistency, efficiency, interoperability, and overall situational awareness.</p>

                <p>TAXII&#0153; defines a set of services and message exchanges that, when implemented, enable sharing of actionable cyber threat information across organization and product/service boundaries. TAXII, through its member specifications, defines concepts, protocols, and message exchanges to exchange cyber threat information for the detection, prevention, and mitigation of cyber threats. TAXII is not a specific information sharing initiative or application and does not attempt to define trust agreements, governance, or other non-technical aspects of cyber threat information sharing. Instead, TAXII empowers organizations to achieve improved situational awareness about emerging threats, enabling organizations to share the information they choose with the partners they choose.
                <br /><br />
                TAXII is the preferred method of exchanging information represented using the Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX&#0153;) language, enabling organizations to share structured cyber threat information in a secure and automated manner.</p>
